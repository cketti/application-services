//! # Signing in and out
//!
//! These are methods for managing the signed-in state, such as authenticating via
//! an OAuth flow or disconnecting from the user's account.
//!
//! The Firefox Accounts system supports two methods for connecting an application
//! to a user's account:
//!
//!    - A traditional OAuth flow, where the user is directed to a webpage to enter
//!      their account credentials and then redirected back to the application.
//!      This is exposed by the [`connect_with_oauth`](FirefoxAccount::connect_with_oauth)
//!      method.
//!
//!    - A device pairing flow, where the user scans a QRCode presented by another
//!      app that is already connected to the account, which then directs them to
//!      a webpage for a simplified signing flow. This is exposed by the
//!      [`connect_with_pairing`](FirefoxAccount::connect_with_pairing) method.
//!
//! Technical details of the pairing flow can be found in the [Firefox Accounts
//! documentation hub](https://mozilla.github.io/ecosystem-platform/docs/features/firefox-accounts/pairing).
